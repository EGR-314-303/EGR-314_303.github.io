## Design Concepts <br />
Here are our initial design concepts. The overall product we want to make is a kind of solar panel tracking system that will follow light and adjust the panel accordingly.

Design 1 <br />
* **Solar Tracking:** The light sensor on the front detects the direction and intensity of sunlight. The motor adjusts the solar panel angle by tilting it up or down (pitch adjustment) to ensure the panel remains perpendicular to the sunlight for maximum energy capture.
* **Motorized Adjustment:** The motor mounted at the back of the system controls the movement of the solar panel. By adjusting the panel's angle, the system enhances its efficiency in gathering solar energy throughout the day.
* **Stable Base with Electronics:** The base houses the PCB, which is responsible for controlling the system, processing sensor data, and sending signals to the motor to adjust the panel accordingly.

Design 2 <br />
* **Solar Tracking:** The system adjusts the orientation of the solar panel based on the sun's position. The light sensor detects sunlight, and the motor moves the solar panel accordingly, using the links for mechanical adjustment.
* **Motorized Adjustment:** The motor-driven system allows the panel to track the sun throughout the day, enhancing energy generation efficiency by keeping the panel perpendicular to the sunlight.
* **Control System:** The PCB in the base processes sensor data and controls the motor. The second sensor provides additional feedback, ensuring the system operates correctly under various conditions.

Design 3 <br />
* **Solar Tracking:** This system optimizes the solar panel's alignment according to the sun's position. A light sensor detects sunlight, and the motor adjusts the panel's angle using mechanical linkages.
* **Motorized Adjustment:** The motorized setup enables the solar panel to follow the sun throughout the day, maximizing energy efficiency by maintaining a perpendicular orientation to sunlight.
* **Control System:** A PCB in the base processes data from the sensor and manages the motor. An additional sensor provides feedback, ensuring proper operation in different conditions.

Final Selected Design

* **Solar Tracking:** The system adjusts the orientation of the solar panel based on the sun's position. The light sensors mounted at the base detects sunlight, and the motor moves the solar panel accordingly
* **Motorized Adjustment:** The one motor-driven system allows the panel to track the sun. maximizing energy efficiency by maintaining a perpendicular orientation to sunlight.
*  **Control System:** The PCB in the base processes sensor data and controls the motor. The second sensor, one that is a humidity sensor, provides additional feedback, ensuring the system operates correctly under various conditions.
*  **Why We chose this Design:** While making the Team's official PCB already in the manufacturing process, one of our members noticed that the one motor driver installed on the PCB could only operate one stepper motor. At the final minute, we had to make a change to the design using only one motor for orientation. During the design process, we figured this was an okay change since it was beneficial to our team's power budget from using two motors, both using 12 volts, to only one.
