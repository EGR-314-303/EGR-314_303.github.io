# Component Selection

Here you can find all of our chosen components for our project. At the end is an Appendix listing the other components that were being considered.


**Light Sensor:**


| solution | Pros | Cons |
| ---- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Veml7700 | Relatively inexpensive, filters for ambient light adjustment, built-in tempsensor for thermal offset/shutdown | Mfg lead time of 6 weeks, J-leads might be difficult to solder, small footprint | _Email_ |
| Rationale: | The third option has too little to add while being difficult to work with so it was immediately ruled out. With option 2, it met the criteria and is probably the best choice. The issue is that it costs nearly $5 for each and our budget is already limited. This makes using the first option a better idea, since the difference between them is not that large. The high end dynamic range is about the largest difference at around 20k lx.|
