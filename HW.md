# Hardware Proposal

Here is an image of the full V1 schematic for our team's board. The name next to the subsystem is the member that is working that portion of the project. The ESP32 subsystem will be left as a team endeavour.

You can also find a full intelligent PDF file for the schematic below. This link goes to an external shared folder link for the file as markdown does not display PDF.

Along with all of this is a list of the Bill of Materials required to build this design. More will be added or removed if we find issues in our V1 iteration as needed.
