## Team Organization <a name="organization"></a>

**Mission Statement** <br />
Our mission is to create an environment sensing and adjusting product that can be useful to most everyday people and fulfills all the project requirements within the budget we have been given.

When drafting the team charter we focused on trying to give people responsibilities that fell within their strengths. Along with that, we wanted to make sure we discussed conflict resolution within the group so we knew what problems would require escalation to the teaching staff. When creating our goal we discussed what we wanted to get out of the class itself. A link to the page with the full charter is listed below.

## User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements <a name="user"></a>

When coming up with the user needs we found products that were similar or exactly what we aimed to create. From there we went through top reviews and bottom reviews to find common praises or complaints about the product. Since the reviews do not always say exactly what issue the user had, it was up to us to find what the user really meant and how that translated into a specific need. A link to our full User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements page is below.

## Design Ideation <a name="ideation"></a>

When coming up with our designs we looked over all the user needs that we had ranked and the features we thought were most important. Our main focus was trying to create a system that would not weigh much so that it could be transported, and that took up as little space as possible for the same reason. When brainstorming ideas we looked at the user needs and tried to directly correlate that into a feature. We found that just randomly listing off ideas was not a good use of time. The design concepts were sketched by two members based on our finalized ideas. 

Ultimately, we chose the first design for ease of build within the alloted timeline, and because the pitch turning was more unique to solar panels than the standard yaw.

Our block diagram shows a general overview of our major components and how they are connected to the microcontroller we selected. You can find the diagram in the link at the top or directly below.
